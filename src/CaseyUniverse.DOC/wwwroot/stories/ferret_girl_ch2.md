Fireball destroys the sun and Terry, Zack, and Ferret's unnamed sister are
shot into space. Terry says, "I'm not even going to ask why we got shot
into space." Zack asks, "I've got a bigger question, why are we able to
breathe?" Ferret's unnamed sister points out a piece of floating gum,
and Terry warns them not to eat it because it might be poisonous. Zack eats
it anyway and exclaims that it's good, and Ferret's unnamed sister tries
it as well and agrees. Terry thinks they're insane, and Zack jokes that
they are.

Later, Terry asks if they hear something, and Ferret's unnamed sister
immediately denies responsibility. Terry asks what she's talking about,
and she backs down. Suddenly, a train appears out of nowhere and stops
near them. Zack gets excited and exclaims, "Cool, a train!" Terry had been
hoping for a ship and is disappointed. Ferret's unnamed sister tells him
to loosen up and enjoy the ride. Terry reluctantly gets in the train
with Zack and Ferret's unnamed sister.

An hour later, Zack is getting restless and asks if they're there yet.
Terry is confused and asks where they're going. Suddenly, Shadow the
hedgehog appears out of nowhere and says, "Forbidden planet," before
disappearing again. Terry is angry and blames Zack for their predicament. Z
giggles and says softly, "Izzle," to which Terry tells him to stop with
the izzle. Ferret's unnamed sister joins in and says, "Izzle," and Terry
tells them both to knock it off. Ferret's unnamed sister curses, and Z
admits he's bored.

After what seems like forever, the space train finally reaches the
Forbidden planet. Zack and Ferret's unnamed sister both admit they're
scared.

Zack turned to the group and exclaimed, "Hey look, we're here!" Ferret's
unnamed sister and Zack's friend were clearly scared. Terry responded
ominously, "You should be."

Later, the group found themselves on a forbidden planet, riding a roller
coaster. The computer instructed them to keep their hands and feet
inside the car, but Zack joked, "If you feel the need, please do it next to
your friend." Terry was not amused and asked, "You're kidding, right?"
As the car moved along, the group saw sets with Barney and Teletubbies
and screamed in terror.

After a few loops, the ride came to a stop, and they were thrown out
into a dance club. Zack declared, "You call this forbidden? Now, back there
on that ride turned out to be forbidden." Terry warned him not to start
DJing, but Zack was undeterred and asked Ferret's unnamed sister if she had
brought her music. She confirmed that she had Voices of Spring 2005 Home
and Voices of Summer 2004 Walking Soul with her.

The party continued for 80 hours, much to Terry's disbelief. Ferret's
unnamed sister revealed that she knew the minks Jit and Liem from the
pig war. Zack was stunned and whispered to her, "There was a pig war?" She
confirmed it, and Zack responded, "I hope you're lying. Now go back over
there and talk to them."

Later, the group boarded a spaceship to escape the planet. Liem asked
Jit not to make any jokes, and Zack questioned why they were on the ship.
Terry reminded him that it was to leave the planet. However, they were
intercepted by space cops, but Ferret's unnamed sister had a solution.
She flashed the cops, causing them to crash their ships.

Zack was impressed and grabbed her, exclaiming, "Oh mama..." Terry tried to
calm him down, but Zack was insistent, declaring, "She's MINE!" The rest of
the group looked on in shock, while Terry simply shrugged and said,
"Fine."

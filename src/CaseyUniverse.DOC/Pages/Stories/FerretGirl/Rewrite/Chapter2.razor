    <p>Fireball destroys the sun and Terry, Z, and Ferret’s unnamed sister are shot into space. Terry says, “I’m not even going to ask why we got shot into space.” Z asks, “I’ve got a bigger question, why are we able to breathe?” Ferret’s unnamed sister points out a piece of floating gum, and Terry warns them not to eat it because it might be poisonous. Z eats it anyway and exclaims that it’s good, and Ferret’s unnamed sister tries it as well and agrees. Terry thinks they’re insane, and Z jokes that they are.</p>
    <p>Later, Terry asks if they hear something, and Ferret’s unnamed sister immediately denies responsibility. Terry asks what she’s talking about, and she backs down. Suddenly, a train appears out of nowhere and stops near them. Z gets excited and exclaims, “Cool, a train!” Terry had been hoping for a ship and is disappointed. Ferret’s unnamed sister tells him to loosen up and enjoy the ride. Terry reluctantly gets in the train with Z and Ferret’s unnamed sister.</p>
    <p>An hour later, Z is getting restless and asks if they’re there yet. Terry is confused and asks where they’re going. Suddenly, Shadow the hedgehog appears out of nowhere and says, “Forbidden planet,” before disappearing again. Terry is angry and blames Z for their predicament. Z giggles and says softly, “Izzle,” to which Terry tells him to stop with the izzle. Ferret’s unnamed sister joins in and says, “Izzle,” and Terry tells them both to knock it off. Ferret’s unnamed sister curses, and Z admits he’s bored.</p>
    <p>After what seems like forever, the space train finally reaches the Forbidden planet. Z and Ferret’s unnamed sister both admit they’re scared.</p>
    <p>Z turned to the group and exclaimed, “Hey look, we’re here!” Ferret’s unnamed sister and Z’s friend were clearly scared. Terry responded ominously, “You should be.”</p>
    <p>Later, the group found themselves on a forbidden planet, riding a roller coaster. The computer instructed them to keep their hands and feet inside the car, but Z joked, “If you feel the need, please do it next to your friend.” Terry was not amused and asked, “You’re kidding, right?” As the car moved along, the group saw sets with Barney and Teletubbies and screamed in terror.</p>
    <p>After a few loops, the ride came to a stop, and they were thrown out into a dance club. Z declared, “You call this forbidden? Now, back there on that ride turned out to be forbidden.” Terry warned him not to start DJing, but Z was undeterred and asked Ferret’s unnamed sister if she had brought her music. She confirmed that she had Voices of Spring 2005 Home and Voices of Summer 2004 Walking Soul with her.</p>
    <p>The party continued for 80 hours, much to Terry’s disbelief. Ferret’s unnamed sister revealed that she knew the minks Jit and Liem from the pig war. Z was stunned and whispered to her, “There was a pig war?” She confirmed it, and Z responded, “I hope you’re lying. Now go back over there and talk to them.”</p>
    <p>Later, the group boarded a spaceship to escape the planet. Liem asked Jit not to make any jokes, and Z questioned why they were on the ship. Terry reminded him that it was to leave the planet. However, they were intercepted by space cops, but Ferret’s unnamed sister had a solution. She flashed the cops, causing them to crash their ships.</p>
    <p>Z was impressed and grabbed her, exclaiming, “Oh mama…” Terry tried to calm him down, but Z was insistent, declaring, “She’s MINE!” The rest of the group looked on in shock, while Terry simply shrugged and said, “Fine.”</p>

        <p><strong>What is DOC?</strong></p>
        <p>DOC stands for Document of Cartoons, and it’s an archive of all my work from roughly 2005 to 2009. It includes a variety of cartoons and illustrations that I created during that time.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did you make it?</strong></p>
        <p>I created DOC back in 2007 to archive my work from 2005 because my style had grown more complex and expressive. I wanted to have a record of my progress as an artist and keep all my work in one place.</p>
        <p><strong>What is Furry Blue DJ?</strong></p>
        <p>Furry Blue DJ was the name of my original website for my artwork. It started out as my character Zack’s alter-ego, and I used it as a way to showcase my art. When I finally had a chance to publish the site, Furry Blue DOC became its sister site, and I used it to archive my earlier work.</p>
        <p><strong>Why did you waive copyright of your artwork and characters?</strong></p>
        <p>I decided to waive copyright of my artwork and characters because, in today’s world, copyright doesn’t always make sense. The only people who tend to benefit from life-plus-seventy-year copyright terms are large corporations and estates. When I created a lot of my earlier artwork, I was just a teenager having fun, and my understanding of copyright was limited. Additionally, I don’t see any reason to profit off of artwork I created when I was younger, and I want to share it with others who might enjoy it without any legal restrictions.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Casey Universe?</strong></p>
        <p>Casey Universe was originally the name for an unpublished trilogy that I had been working on. Over time, it evolved into a fictional universe that I created, full of my ideas and characters. It now serves as the direct successor to Furry Blue DJ, and I use it as a way to share my ongoing projects and ideas.</p>
        <p><strong>What’s with the progress times?</strong></p>
        <p>DOC may seem simple, but it’s actually built using a web app framework called Blazor WebAssembly. This was the best option for me to host it without using PHP. As a result, it may take a bit longer to load and display images, especially if you have a slower internet connection.</p>
        <p><strong>If you’re using a web app framework, why not build it as a web app?</strong></p>
        <p>Not everything needs to be built as a web app. DOC is a simple gallery, but it still requires a lot of work to populate each section with images, such as the gallery, wallpaper, and gift art sections. Plus, building it as a web app would have required even more time and effort. I wanted to focus on the content and the user experience, so I decided to keep it simple and use a framework that allowed me to do that.</p>
        <p><strong>Even if you’re not going to make it a web app, why not use Bootstrap for the UI?</strong></p>
        <p>I have experimented with integrating Bootstrap into DOC, but the default light theme clashes with the natural dark look of DOC. I like the retro feel of DOC, and I think it’s nice to have something that feels like the early days of the internet. Even though the technology behind it is much more advanced, I enjoy the simplicity and nostalgia of the design.</p>

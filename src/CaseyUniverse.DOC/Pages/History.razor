<p>Casey Universe DOC was created in 2007 as Furry Blue DOC, serving as an archive of my old artwork, inspired by Cartoon Network's, which contained storyboards, model sheets and backgrounds. As my style continued to evolve from 2005 to the site's initial creation, the discrepancy between old and new became glaringly obvious. So, DOC was created as a sister site to the main.</p>
<p>All the original Furry Blue websites were created in FrontPage 2003. My mom was taught web design in collage, and I wound up going with her to collage over the summer, where I accidentally taught myself it out of fun creating websites. DOC's original design was based on the first mockup of The Furry Blue DJ website, while adopting Cartoon Network's DOC theme. DOC was later maintained in Dreamweaver 8 when I switched to macOS. It made use of Lightbox and scripts from Dynamic Drive to improve performance. While <a href="view/screenshots/furry_blue_doc_v2.png">later iterations</a> would use more advanced technologies, such as PHP, for better maintainability, it wasn't nearly to the level the scale of this.</p>

<p>However, the events of the 2008 financial crises, the rise in social networks, along with other personal life factors, meant hosting my own personal websites was put on hiatus. It wasn't until GitHub and their ability to host websites that it saw a brief resurgence as TPaw DOC. That wound up being cut short as well following tensions with an open source project.</p>
<p>Today's DOC was born from Casey Universe. The project began as a series of short trilogies where Zack and his friends have to reclaim the only city they have after it fell into civil war, with the second part intended on actually exploring the galaxy. While it was never completed because my writing skills weren't that good, it wound up serving as the home for all my characters and their world, now released under the public domain.</p>
<p>Casey Universe DOC uses Microsoft's .NET and Blazor WebAssembly. Funny, how I wound up coming full circle. Due to how much time has passed, it merges content from all past Furry Blue websites into it, and aims to serve a similar purpose to Cartoon Network's DOC.</p>
